    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook generates an entire campaign built on the pre-existing template generator function used in the email template editor. The flow has the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The user provides a text prompt explaining what the email campaign is for, and how many sends they want to create. They can optionally provide \"design guidance\", a plain text explanation of what they want the emails to look like, and can upload any number of photos they'd like to include. We'll prompt the user to provide a description of these images which will help the algo figure out where to put them in the templates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Building the campaign spec\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in creating the campaign is to create the campaign plan, and define campaign styling. The campaign plan is a list of email subject lines and briefs equal to the number of sends that the user has specified they'd like to create for the campaign. This is generated all at once, so that they are cohesive with one another. Campaign styling is a single unified design specification that will be used across the templates in the campaign.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The prompt is fed to the `seek_clarification` function, which prompts GPT to think of five clarifying questions that might improve the quality of the template recommendations.\n",
    "- Once the user answers the clarifying questions, the questions and answers are added to all the following prompts\n",
    "- Next, we run `define_campaign_plan`. This function takes the prompt with clarifications and asks GPT to provide subject lines and briefs for as many email sends as the user specified at the beginning. Each of these will be fed into the email template generator function iteratively.\n",
    "- Next, we run `define_campaign_styling`. This prompts GPT to specify a design language for all of the emails in the campaign. This design specification is included in the prompt for all email generations, to ensure that the templates that are generated are cohesive.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Enriching the campaign spec\n",
    "\n",
    "A major part of our value add here is that we can incorporate images relevant to the customer as well as CTA links to known Momos third party links for inclusion in the email templates. This greatly improves the \"completeness\" of the resulting email templates.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Images*\n",
    "- We have a number of options for integrating images into the templates. As mentioned above, the user can upload images to use in the campaign along with descriptions, which are passed in a JSON to `campaign_images` in the main function. Additionally, we have the parameter `recommend_images`, which takes an array with options `['PEXELS', 'DALLE']`. If these options are specified, we will search for images relevant to the template being generated using the Pexels api (using the `recommend_pexels_photos` function, or will generate them using DALLE (using the `recommend_dalle_photos` function), or both. These images are combined with the images the user uploaded (if present) for consideration by the algorithm when designing templates.\n",
    "\n",
    "*CTA Links*\n",
    "\n",
    "- This is currently supplied via a JSON, but we'll need to write a function that queries them from the DB.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Putting it all together\n",
    "\n",
    "- Finally, we take all of the email subjects and briefs generated in the campaign plan, with the addition of the clarifications from `seek_clarification`, the design specification from `define_campaign_styling`, and the images from and generate an array of templates"
